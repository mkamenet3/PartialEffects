# PartialEffects

This repository contains the code for the analysis in "Partial Effects in Environmental Mixtures â€“ Evidence and Guidance on Methods and Implications" by Kamenetsky, Welch, Bommarito, Buckley, O'Brien, White, McElrath, Cantonwine, Ferguson, Keil (2024)


The files used in the analysis are described below:

- *LIFECODES_analysis.R*: script analyzing the partial effects for the LIFECODES study
- *LTL_analysis.R*: script analyzing the partial effects for the NHANES study of leukocytic telomere length
- simstudy_ANALYSIS.Rmd: R Markdown analyzing simulation data; simulation study was performed on Biowuld HPC server
- simstudy_partialeffects.R: script for the simulation study
- simstudy_partialeffectsfunctions.R: script containing functions used for the simulation study

The data for the two data examples are not made publicly available due to privacy issues.

Code co-developed by M.Kamenetsky and A.Keil; repository maintained by M.Kamenetsky
